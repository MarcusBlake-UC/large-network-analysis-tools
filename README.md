An experimental adaptation of the ESRI large network analysis python script to accommodate very large OD matrices.

The script was modified to calculate the driving distances between every ZIP Plus 4 codes and every type of service in the US State of Ohio. 

The purpose is to create a detailed distance database that will support the calculation of a number of accessibility indexes e.g.   

A  The script is modified to be iteratively applied to each County in Ohio 

Input

The tools and code samples here help you solve large network analysis problems in ArcGIS Pro. We have provided a python script that can solve a large origin destination cost matrix problem by chunking the input data, solving in parallel, and combining the results into a single output.

## Features
* The SolverTools.tbx toolbox has a geoprocessing tool called "Solve Origin Destination Cost Matrix" that can be used to solve large origin destination cost matrix problems. You can run this tool as-is out of the box with no changes to the code.
* The odcm.py script does all the work. You can modify this script to suit your needs, or you can use it as an example when writing your own script.

## Instructions

1. Download the latest release
2. Modify the code to suit your needs
3. Run the code in standalone python, or run the provided geoprocessing tool from within ArcGIS Pro.

## Requirements

* ArcGIS Pro 2.5 or later
* One of the following three options:
  * A routable [network dataset](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/help/analysis/networks/what-is-network-dataset-.htm) and the Network Analyst extension license
  * An ArcGIS Online account with routing privileges and sufficient [credits](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/tool-reference/appendices/geoprocessing-tools-that-use-credits.htm#ESRI_SECTION1_3EF40A7C01C042D8A76DB9518B793E9E)
  * A portal with [ArcGIS Enterprise routing services](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/help/analysis/networks/using-arcgis-enterprise-routing-services.htm) configured.
* Origin and destination points you wish to analyze
